## 📖 Description

CODECHITRA-LMS is a full-fledged Learning Management System built by a passionate Front-End Engineer who also loves to explore the depths of backend and cloud technologies. I enjoy teaching and simplifying web development concepts, and this platform is designed with the vision of one day launching my own coding courses.

This project showcases a complete end-to-end solution — from intuitive user interfaces and seamless UX, to robust backend systems and modern cloud deployment. Built with scalability, performance, and clean architecture in mind, CODECHITRA-LMS reflects my commitment to mastering both front-end and back-end engineering.
